<h3 id="table-of-content">Table of content</h3>

<p>As a general <a href="https://codurance.com/videos/2018-10-28-nature-of-learning">rule</a> for effective learning when reading, it is recommended that you
read the table of contents and get an idea of what the book contains and how it
is structured.</p>

<p>This book&rsquo;s table of content is a bit messy and some
titles are not very descriptive, after separating the wheat from the chaff one could
say the content can be split into the following modules:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../javascript-allonge-module-one">Module 1: The JavaScript functions, their context and wonders.</a></li>
<li>Module 2: Rebinding and references.</li>
<li>Module 3: Objects, mutation and state.</li>
<li>Module 4: Instances and classes.</li>
<li>Module 5: Sequence.</li>
<li>Module 6: New ideas.</li>
</ul>
