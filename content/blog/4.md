## Working with multiple accounts in gcloud command line SDK ##

Gcloud tutorials seem oriented to having just one account but if you want to have multiple accounts (i.e. one for work and one personal) on the same machine, you'll find out the `gcloud auth login` command won't give you what you need. 

### Here are the steps to add a second account:

**Prep:** My work account will be called with <b>default</b> name and my personal account will be called <b>rosana-personal</b>.

To get the **first one** set, I just had to do `gcloud auth login` and the browser opened to use Google Oauth and set account configuration data on my machine.

To get the **second one** set, I had to create an empty config first `gcloud config configurations create rosana-personal` and then login but without browser, using the `--no-launch-browser` flag.

```
gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser
```


### Where is the config living?

You can see under `~/.config/gcloud` a bunch of files. For each account you have configured on your machine, you will have a file under `~/.config/gcloud/configurations` and the <b>active configuration</b> is set by `~/.config/gcloud/active_config`
