Hi,

This is just a bunch of files for my personal site.

I will build it progressively, it's not finished yet.

1. Plain-html site [Started].
2. Create an OrchardCMS site [To-do].
3. Upload OrchardCMS site with the same template used for Plain-html site [To-do].

You can take a look and see how I'm doing so far through this link: [http://totemika.github.io/](http://totemika.github.io/)
